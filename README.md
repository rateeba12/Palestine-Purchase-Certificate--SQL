# Purchase Certificate SQL Table

This project is designed to create a Purchase Certificate SQL Table based on Palestine state standards. Users can upload data in the following format: (OrderId, ParcelCode, PurchaseCertificateNumber, ParcelPrice, ShipDate).

### Functional Requirements:

1. Drop any row that doesn't contain both OrderId and PurchaseCertificateNumber.
  
2. The system should handle the PurchaseCertificateNumber and OrderTotalPrice, which equals the total sum of all parcelsâ€™ prices we already have.
   
3. If an input row lacks ParcelPrice, set it to zero; otherwise, maintain the given value.
   
4. If an input row lacks ParcelCode but has a price, assign that price to the entire order.

   ## Project Structure:

- `purchase_certificate.sql`: SQL file for creating the Purchase Certificate table.
- `test_cases.sql`: Test cases to ensure the functionality of the system.
- `ER_model.png`: Entity-Relationship model representing the database structure.
