Purchase Certificate SQL Table, based on Palestine state standards.
The user uploads the data in the following format: (OrderId, ParcelCode, PurchaseCertificateNumber, ParcelPrice, ShipDate).

### Functional Requirements:

1. Drop any row that doesn't have OrderId and PurchaseCertificateNumber.
  
2. The system should handle the PurchaseCertificateNumber and OrderTotalPrice, which equals the total sum of all parcelsâ€™ prices we already have.
   
3. If the input row lacks ParcelPrice, set it to zero; otherwise, maintain the given value.
   
4. If the input row lacks ParcelCode but has a price, the price should be assigned to the entire order.
